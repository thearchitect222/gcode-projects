    <h1 class="glow">About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I'm Brenda but most of my family and friends like to call me Brendis, Brendy. I am passionate about the little things in life, whether that's a Sunset, Sunrise or simply Nature. I like to spend my time Reading a good book with some tea and
      a sick lo-fi playlist, Painting to my heart's content, listening to a new album or just being present with Music. I can honestly say that Tech, Music and Art are my favorite things
      so I am grateful to be in this Program and to be able to showcase my skills and get the creative juices flowing as well.

    <h2 class="glow">How did I end up in Tech?</h2>
    <br>
    <p> Where do I even begin? I think my earliest memories or signs that I would end up in the world of tech goes back to middle school. I remember being fascinated by an elective that I took by chance; Robotics.
      It was there that I enjoyed tinkering and learning how things worked, how to build something from nothing/scratch and getting to enjoy seeing it come to life. I would also have a lot of fun jailbreaking my iPhone
      if only to see if I could still make it functional. From there, I would be re-introduced to Tech by working for the largest Credit Card Processing Company in Ohio where I learned to troubleshoot POS, Pinpads, Mobile swipers, you name it. As you can see, it should come as no surprise that I enjoy thinking outside the box, trial and error is just a part of the fun. I have come to accept that I thrive in chaos
      and it has made me adaptable to where I can handle anything that comes my way, or in this case, any Project that comes my way.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> I am truly passionate about Front-end development and also looking to delve into Cybersecurity.
      Currently, I am in an Intro to Web Development program that is helping me build a foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      I look forward to this journey and for whatever the future holds.
